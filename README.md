# HOSTEL ALLOTMENT SYSTEM

A modern, full-featured hostel allotment system built with **SvelteKit** that automates the process of assigning participants to hostel rooms based on gender and capacity constraints. Upload participant and hostel data via Excel/CSV, and the system intelligently allocates rooms while managing capacity and generating a downloadable allocation report .

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayushverma9408/Hcakathon-hostel-allotment-system.git
   cd Hcakathon-hostel-allotment-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

### Usage

1. **Prepare your data files:**
   - **Participants Sheet** (.xlsx or .csv) — Must include columns: `Name`, `Gender`
   - **Hostels Sheet** (.xlsx or .csv) — Must include columns: `Hostel Type`, `Room Number`, `Capacity`

2. **Upload files** — Use the file upload interface to select participant and hostel data

3. **Review allocation** — Check the preview table to verify room assignments

4. **Export results** — Download the allocation report as an Excel file

## 🏗 Architecture

### Technical Architecture

The system is built on a client-side architecture that prioritizes performance and user control:

- **Frontend Framework**: SvelteKit with TypeScript for type safety and reactivity
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a responsive, modern UI
- **Spreadsheet Engine**: xlsx (SheetJS) for handling .xlsx and .csv file parsing
- **State Management**: Svelte stores for managing participant and hostel data during the session

### Core Logic Implementation

The allocation algorithm intelligently matches participants to available rooms based on gender and capacity constraints.

#### A. Parsing Logic

The system reads the hostel sheet into an array of objects:
- If `Capacity` is absent, it defaults to 1
- Each room entry is expanded into individual available slots
- Participants are similarly parsed with their attributes

#### B. Allocation Algorithm

The engine performs the following matching process:

$$\text{Allotment}(P_i) = R_j \iff \text{Gender}(P_i) = \text{Type}(R_j) \land \text{Occupancy}(R_j) < \text{Capacity}(R_j)$$

Where:
- $P$ = participant set
- $R$ = room set
- Gender must match hostel type
- Current occupancy must be below capacity

**Allocation Flow:**
1. Parse and validate input files
2. Separate participants by gender
3. Filter available rooms by type
4. Sequentially assign participants to matching rooms
5. Flag unallocated participants as waitlisted
